# The following is the list of URLs where Stanford CoreNLP models can be downloaded. For redundency, we allow
# multiple download locations for different Maven mirrors. Use {0} to replace the
# major version number {1} to replace the minor version number, and {2} to replace the patch
# version number. The build will fill these in automatically.
#
# The file will be downloaded to assets/, but only if the file doesn't already exist there.
